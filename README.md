# Advent of Code 2021

[![Swift 5.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.5-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org)
[![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-12.0+-green.svg?style=flat)](http://developer.apple.com)

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2021, which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Projects are macOS commandline interface projects, built on macOS 12.0 (but should be able to adjust for lower versions) and Swift 5.5.
